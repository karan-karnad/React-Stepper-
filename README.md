#Stepper Flow

What is Stepper Flow ?
  ~ Breaking down a long process with multiple stages of decision making/ status updation into a clearly fragmented number of steps without burdening the users with a plethora of congested selections.
 
How to go about Stepper Flow ?
  ~ The first step involves classifying the stages of selection into clearly defined steps, designers/product teams for large organisations may make this call.
  ~ Define the components/modules for these steps. Follow the react philosophy of independent, self sufficient, single responsibilty components.
